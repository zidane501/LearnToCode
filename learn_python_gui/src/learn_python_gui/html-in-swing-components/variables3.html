<p>Drawing a table like this on pencil and paper is always a good idea <br>and helpful when understanding or fixing code. We also have an <br>automated Python3 visualization tool to virtually execute programs <br>like this one step at a time (see also the link in the top menu). <br>Here's what it looks like when we run the same program on the <br>visualizer. Use the Forward > button or press the arrow key on <br>your keyboard to step forward (or back). Note how the variables <br>change as each line executes. </p>
