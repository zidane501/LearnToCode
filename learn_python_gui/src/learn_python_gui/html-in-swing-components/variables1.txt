<h1> 1: Variables </h1>
<br>Variables act as "storage locations" for data in a program. They <br>are a way of naming information for later usage. Each variable has <br>a name; an example variable name we will use is myLuckyNumber. To <br>store information in a variable, we write a command using an equal <br>sign in the following way:
<br>
<br>«the variable name» = «the value you want to store»
<br>(We use «double angle brackets» in our lessons, like above, to <br>indicate special parts of expressions.) For example, the Python <br>line
<br>myLuckyNumber = 13
<br>stores the value 13 in the variable myLuckyNumber. Then, anywhere <br>you write the variable name myLuckyNumber again, Python retrieves <br>the stored value. Below, there is a short example of using <br>variables. It has more than one line of instructions: Python <br>executes the first line, then the second line, and so forth until <br>it reaches the last line. Press the Run program button to see what <br>it does.
