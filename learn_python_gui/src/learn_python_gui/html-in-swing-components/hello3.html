<h2><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Exercise</font></h2>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> Our first exercise is given below. It asks you to write a program <br> similar to the first one above. Type your program into the box, and <br> when you want to test whether your program correctly performs the <br> task, press the Run program button. If you don't get it correct <br> on the first try, edit the program and try running it again. <br><br>
