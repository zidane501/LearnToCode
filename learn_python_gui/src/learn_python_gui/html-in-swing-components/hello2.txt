	When you run a program you also get to see the output. <br>The example program above only has one command, <br> print"Hello, World!" and it created one line of output,

	<br><br> 

	<font color=blue>Hello, World!</font>

	<br><br>
    
	Here is an analysis of this first program: <br><ul><li>print is the name of a Python command, which sends messages to <br> output.</li><li>The parentheses () after the print command are used to <br> contain what you want to print.</li><li>The quote marks " " are used as a container for the text Hello, <br> World! inside. Without quotes, Python would think that Hello was <br> meant to be a command. This would be cause an error since no such <br> command exists.</li></ul><br>You will learn more about the different pieces of a Python<br> program as you progress through these lessons.

	<br><br> 

	Let's see exactly what happens when we leave out the quotes. <br><br>
